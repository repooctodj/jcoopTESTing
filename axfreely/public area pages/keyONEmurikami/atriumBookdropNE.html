<p> You walk in the front door only to find yourself in some sort of weird front door mini room with lots of windows. There is a book drop to your left, along with a small stool. Looking around, you feel there should be a coat rack to tie the space together, an umbrella stand with a pop of color would make it really shine. Before you can finish being an interior designer, someone comes in the door behind you and asks you to move. The newcomer's bag of books is so large that it knocks you as they try to get over to the book drop. You now understand why this space is so empty. </p>
